Data from "Plant sex influences aquatic-terrestrial interactions" LeRoy et al. 2020, Ecosphere, Vol 11(1), e02994; Mount St Helens 2018 willow leaf litter decomposition study. 

These data are available for subsequent analyses or meta-analyses. It would be great if you could let Dr. Carri LeRoy at LeRoyC@evergreen.edu know more about your research - Thanks!
